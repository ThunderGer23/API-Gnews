<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

##### **Used technology**
* Authentication and authorization: We implement a JWT token-based authentication and authorization system to protect News API endpoints.
* CRUD operations for news: We implement endpoints that allow us to create, read, update and delete news in the database.
* Data validation: We implement data validations to make sure that the data sent to the API is correct and consistent.
* Advanced queries: We implement endpoints that allow us to perform advanced queries, such as searching for news by category or filtering news by date.

### Built With

* **_Python_**: We use Python as the primary programming language to develop our news API.
* **_Flask_**: We use the Flask framework to create our web application and define the API endpoints.
* **_JWT (JSON Web Tokens)_**: We use JWT to implement token-based authentication and authorization in our API.
* **_MySQL_**: We use MySQL as our database management system to store and retrieve news data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Welcome to the News API! This guide will help you get started using and developing on top of the API quickly and easily.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed in your development environment:

* Python: Verify that you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

* Docker: Verify that you have Docker installed on your system. You can download it from docker.com.

In case you have Linux you can use

* Your distro's package manager
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install python3 docker
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [APIGNews](https://github.com/ThunderGer23/API-Gnews)
2. Create a .env file in the root of the project and configure the environment variables for the database connection, for example:
   
   ```
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
    DB_NAME=api_news
    ```

3. Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   
   ```sh
    docker compose up
4. Or create your a virtual environment for the project:
* Run `python3 -m venv venv` to create the virtual environment.
* Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary dependencies.
5. Running the API with the following command
   ```sh
    python index.py
_This command will start the Flask development server, and the API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000._

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Discover the various use cases and scenarios where you can leverage the News API to its fullest potential. From web and mobile applications to data analysis and automation, the API offers diverse possibilities for integrating news content into your projects. Explore the examples and find inspiration to incorporate the API into your next development.

![Image Description: Authenticated User with Token Return:](/images/CapturaAuth.png)

**Image Description: Authenticated User with Token Return:**

The image showcases the response from the API after successfully authenticating a user. The user submits a request with their login credentials and receives an access token in response. The token is an encrypted string that contains information about the user's identity and active session. By including the token with each subsequent request, the user can access protected resources and perform authorized actions within the application.

![Image Description: Articles Returned by the API:](/images/CapturaArticles.png)

**Image Description: Articles Returned by the API:**

The image displays a list of articles retrieved through a query to the News API. Each article is represented as an individual entry in the list and includes relevant information such as the title, description, and source. Articles can be filtered and sorted based on various criteria, allowing users to obtain specific and up-to-date information on topics of interest. This data can be utilized to display news in an application, perform analysis, or feed other automated processes.
